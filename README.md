# ShapeMotion
ShapeMotion is a Java-based graphical app that teaches object-oriented principles and event handling. Users can add and customize shapes with varying widths and path types. Each shape moves on its own path and is labeled. Invalid inputs for width are rejected, ensuring proper shape creation.
